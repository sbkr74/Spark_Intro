#### **Using SQL Expression as a String**
You should use a proper SQL condition within `.filter()`:
```python
filter_df = df.filter("Age = 50 OR Age = 30")
filter_df.show()
```

#### **Using PySpark Column Expressions**
A more recommended approach is using the `col()` function from `pyspark.sql.functions`:
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

filter_df = df.filter((col("Age") == 50) | (col("Age") == 30))
filter_df.show()
```
- This method is **preferred** because it avoids SQL string parsing errors and improves readability.
