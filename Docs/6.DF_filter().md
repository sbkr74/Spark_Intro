### **Issue in Code**
```python
filter_df = df.filter("Age == 50" or "Age == 30")
```
- The expression inside `.filter()` should be a valid SQL or PySpark expression.
- `"Age == 50"` is a string, which is always `True` in Python when used in `or` conditions.
- `"Age == 50" or "Age == 30"` is evaluated by Python **before** being passed to `.filter()`, resulting in only `"Age == 50"` being considered.

### **Correct Approach**

#### **Using SQL Expression as a String**
You should use a proper SQL condition within `.filter()`:
```python
filter_df = df.filter("Age = 50 OR Age = 30")
filter_df.show()
```

#### **Using PySpark Column Expressions**
A more recommended approach is using the `col()` function from `pyspark.sql.functions`:
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

filter_df = df.filter((col("Age") == 50) | (col("Age") == 30))
filter_df.show()
```
- This method is **preferred** because it avoids SQL string parsing errors and improves readability.

### **Issue in  Code**
```python
filter_df = df.filter("Age == 50 and Name == 'NULL'")
```
- **Incorrect usage of `==` in SQL expressions**:  
  - In SQL-style expressions for PySpark, **single equals (`=`) should be used instead of double equals (`==`)**.
- **Possible misunderstanding of 'NULL'**:
  - If you are checking for missing (null) values in the `Name` column, using `"Name == 'NULL'"` won't work because `NULL` is a special SQL value.
  - `'NULL'` (as a string) is different from `NULL` (actual missing value).

---

### **Corrected Code**
#### **1️⃣ If You Want to Match the String `'NULL'` (as a literal text)**  
If `Name` contains the literal string `'NULL'`, use:
```python
filter_df = df.filter("Age = 50 AND Name = 'NULL'")
filter_df.show()
```
✅ This correctly applies an SQL-style filter.

#### **2️⃣ If You Want to Check for `NULL` Values (Missing Data)**
If you want to filter rows where `Name` is actually `NULL` (missing value), use **`IS NULL`** instead:
```python
filter_df = df.filter("Age = 50 AND Name IS NULL")
filter_df.show()
```
✅ This filters rows where `Age` is 50 and `Name` is truly `NULL` (not a string `'NULL'`).

#### **3️⃣ Using PySpark Column Expressions (Recommended Approach)**
If you prefer using PySpark functions (which are more robust and readable), use:
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

filter_df = df.filter((col("Age") == 50) & (col("Name").isNull()))
filter_df.show()
```
✅ This is the best practice as it avoids SQL string parsing issues.
