The message  **default log level** notification from Spark. It indicates that the **log level** for Sparkâ€™s internal logging system is set to **"WARN"** by default.

### Explanation:

- **Log Level**: This refers to the severity of messages that are logged by Spark. Different levels of logging can be set to control how much information is displayed. The available log levels are typically:
  - **ERROR**: Only error messages are shown (the most restrictive level).
  - **WARN**: Warnings and errors are displayed.
  - **INFO**: Information, warnings, and errors are displayed.
  - **DEBUG**: Debug information, info, warnings, and errors are displayed.
  - **TRACE**: The most detailed level, showing trace-level information (usually very verbose).

The default log level is set to **"WARN"** in Spark, meaning it will only log **warning** messages and **error** messages, which helps avoid overwhelming users with too much log information.

### How to Adjust Log Level:

If you need more detailed logging (for example, to debug issues), you can change the log level programmatically using the `setLogLevel()` method.

#### Example:

To change the log level to **"INFO"**:

```python
# Set the log level to INFO
spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel("INFO")
```

This will display informational logs along with warnings and errors.

To set the log level to **"ERROR"** (to only show errors and suppress warnings/info):

```python
# Set the log level to ERROR
spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel("ERROR")
```

Similarly, you can use other log levels based on your needs.

#### For SparkR:
If you're using SparkR (Spark's R API), the command is:

```R
# Set the log level in SparkR
setLogLevel("INFO")
```

### Why Adjust Log Levels?
- **Debugging**: If you're debugging and want more detailed logs, you would set the log level to `DEBUG` or `TRACE`.
- **Production**: In a production environment, you may want to minimize logging overhead, so you'd set it to `ERROR` or `WARN` to avoid unnecessary logs.
- **Monitoring**: For monitoring the progress or general health of your Spark job, setting it to `INFO` can give you a good balance of information.

### Summary:
The message you see is just an informational message indicating that the default logging level is set to "WARN". You can change the log level to suit your needs for debugging or production environments by using `sc.setLogLevel(newLevel)` in Spark.
